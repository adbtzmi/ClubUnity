## Challenge to develop this system:
1. **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system's functionalities.
2. **Data Management:** Designing a robust database schema to manage various types of data efficiently, while ensuring data integrity and consistency.
3. **User Interface Design:** Creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for administrators to manage clubs, applications, events, and students.
4. **System Scalability:** Building a scalable system architecture that can handle a growing number of users, clubs, and events without compromising performance.
5. **Application Logic:** Implementing complex business logic to support various functionalities such as club registration, event management, application processing, and user profile management.
6. **Security Considerations:** Addressing security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) to protect the system and its users from malicious attacks.
